# iNClassSec-ESM: Non-Classical secreted protein predictor based on multimodal protein language model
## Introduction
Non-classical secreted proteins (NCSPs) are a class of proteins lacking signal peptides, secreted
by Gram-positive bacteria through non-classical secretion pathways. With the increasing demand
for highly secreted proteins in recent years, non-classical secretion pathways have received more
attention due to their advantages over classical secretion pathways (Sec/Tat). However, because the
mechanisms of non-classical secretion pathways are not yet clear, identifying NCSPs through biolog-
ical experiments is expensive and time-consuming, making it imperative to develop computational
methods to address this issue. Existing NCSP prediction methods mainly use traditional handcrafted
featurs to represent proteins from sequence information, which limits the modelsâ€™ ability to
capture complex protein characteristics. In this study, we propose a novel NCSP predictor, iNClassSec-
ESM, which combines deep learning with traditional classifiers to enhance prediction performance.
iNClassSec-ESM integrates an XGBoost model trained on comprehensive handcrafted features and a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained on hidden layer embeddings from the protein language model
(PLM) ESM3. The ESM3 is the recently proposed multimodal PLM and has not yet been fully
explored in terms of protein representation. In this study, we extracted hidden layer embeddings from
ESM3 as inputs for multiple classifiers and deep learning networks, and compared them with existing
PLMs.

Benchmark experiments indicate that iNClassSec-ESM outperforms most of existing methods
across multiple performance metrics and could serve as an effective tool for discovering potential
NCSPs. Additionally, the ESM3 hidden layer embeddings, as an innovative protein representation
method, show great potential for the application in broader protein-related classification tasks.

## Dependencies
- **Python Version:** `3.10`
- **Required Packages:** See [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) for a complete list of dependencies.

## Dataset
`dataset/` directory contains data compiled from previous experimental summaries. This includes various protein sequences and related experimental results that serve as the foundation for our analysis.

`result/` directory holds the processed data generated using the POSSUM software. Specifically, it includes:

- **Segmented Protein Sequences**: Individual protein sequences that have been partitioned by the POSSUM tool for detailed analysis.
- **PSSM Matrices**: Corresponding Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSM) calculated for each segmented protein sequence.

## Usage
- **Evaluation the Model** `stack_5cv.py`

Run this script to produce final ensemble model performance based on the 5-fold cross-validation and plot the ROC curve.

- **Train the Model** `train.py`

This script performs hyperparameter tuning and model training on your dataset using 5-fold cross-validation. The trained model parameters are saved to a file, which can then be used for making predictions.

- **Make Predictions** `prediction.py`

This script loads the trained model and makes predictions on a new dataset.

**Please ensure that the feature descriptors for the sequences to be predicted are correctly generated and saved in the `feature/` directory.
